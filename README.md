AI-Powered Sudoku Solver Game â€“ Flutter

This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter that combines the power of artificial intelligence with classic Sudoku gameplay. The app allows users to interact with Sudoku puzzles while offering intelligent solving options through AI algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm, Hybrid (Genetic + Backtracking), and pure Backtracking techniques.

The core goal of the project is to demonstrate how AI can enhance traditional puzzle-solving by providing users with smart, real-time assistance or complete solutions. Designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, the app offers both casual play and advanced solving tools for educational or experimental use.

Key Features:

AI-powered Sudoku solver using multiple techniques

Clean and modular Flutter-based UI

User-selectable solving modes (Genetic, Hybrid, Backtracking)

Educational tool for understanding how different algorithms work

Cross-platform mobile support (Android & iOS)

This project reflects the practical integration of AI into mobile game development, showcasing both algorithmic logic and UI/UX design.
